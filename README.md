# Social-Media-Map
Map of WNY featuring all Martial Arts Gyms in the area, categorized by target organization and competitors in the area.
  This project was developed to provide "World Class Taekwondo" (WCTKD), Martial Arts organization local to the Western New York (WNY) area
for the purpose of displaying the market of martial arts instruction-based businesses. The project connects to Google Maps API to display 
the area occupied by each of the five WCTKD locations in the community, distinguishing them from competitors in the area with customized pins.

  This map was utilized in the context of a larger presentation regarding the social media presence of WCTKD in comparison to their competitors
in the area, identifying strengths and areas of growth available for organic online marketing.
